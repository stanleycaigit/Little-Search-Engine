# Little-Search-Engine

My implementation of a simple search engine that performs 3 main operations: identify and index specific keywords that appear in given plain text document(s),
search for user-inputted keywords against the made index, and return a list of documents where these keywords occur and their respective frequencies.

This repository contains some sample text documents, a "noisewords.txt" file that contains a list of word that are irrelevant and must be ignored by the search
engine, a "docs.txt" file that contains the name of all of the sample text documents, and a Makefile.

Through this project, I have learned plentiful about the functionality of HashMaps, HashTables, and Binary Search as all 3 functionalities have been throughly
utilized throughout this project.
